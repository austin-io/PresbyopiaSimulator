# Presbyopia Simulator

## Running

Any static file hosting solution should work. Point the root URL to `index.html`. A demo of this project is hosted on GitHub using the GitHub Pages feature and can be found [here](https://austin-io.github.io/PresbyopiaSimulator)

## Updating URLs for SEO

Start by replacing all instances of `[BASE_URL]` in the code with the hosting domain you wish to use, (ie www.yourwebsite.com). I recommend using VS Code to make this change, because it has a mass find/replace tool you can use. 

Files that should be affected are:
- index.html
- presbyopi.html
- mainfilter_head.js
- mobilechecker.js
